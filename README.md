Created by a team of 3 freshmen as part of school-wide "Hack Day" competition. Placed 2nd in the competition.

The product has two parts, an iOS app and a website, that interact through a Firebase server. The user chooses a photo from his/her phone via the app, which is then uploaded to the Firebase server and accessed through the website. The idea was to be able to get a single photo from a phone to a computer quickly and easily without a cord.

Currently unfinished, but we had enough of it working to properly demo what the finished product would look like. The only unfinished parts are converting the image from a 64 bit string then displaying it on the page, and using the secret code to access specific pictures entered from the app.
